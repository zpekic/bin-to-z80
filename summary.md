# Z80/Intel 8080/8085 Disassembler Project Summary

## Project Overview
This project provides a web-based disassembler for Z80, Intel 8080, and Intel 8085 microprocessors. Users can upload binary files and view the disassembled assembly code with syntax highlighting. The tool supports different CPU instruction sets and provides additional features like hex viewing and label generation.

## Key Components

### CPU Disassembly Engine
- Supports three instruction sets: Z80, Intel 8080, and Intel 8085
- Handles opcodes and extended instructions specific to each CPU
- Creates human-readable assembly language output with proper formatting

### User Interface
- File upload functionality for binary files
- Assembly code viewer with syntax highlighting
- Hex viewer for binary file examination
- Settings panel for configuring disassembly options

### Core Features
- Dynamic label generation for jump and call targets
- Reference tracing for labels
- Support for different instruction sets
- Proper handling of CPU-specific opcodes

## Development History

### Initial Setup
- Created project scaffolding with React, TypeScript, and Vite
- Set up basic UI components using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS
- Added routing with react-router-dom

### Disassembler Core Implementation
- Implemented basic opcode handling for Z80 instruction set
- Added support for Intel 8080 opcodes
- Extended support to Intel 8085 instructions
- Created formatters for hex values and addressing modes

### Label Enhancement
- Implemented label generation system for jump and call targets
- Added functionality to track references to labels
- Enhanced disassembly output to show label references in comments

### Refactoring
- Consolidated implementation into a CPU-agnostic architecture
- Removed redundant Z80-specific files after refactoring to generic CPU implementation
- Improved code organization and reusability

## Current Status
The project is functional and supports disassembly of Z80, Intel 8080, and Intel 8085 binary files. Users can upload files, view the disassembled code with proper labels and references, and examine the binary data in hex format.

## Future Improvements
- Additional support for extended Z80 instructions (CB, DD, ED, FD prefixes)
- Enhanced analysis of code and data sections
- Support for saving and loading disassembly projects
- Export functionality for disassembled code
